# alignment threshold with respect to 1,10,100 values

"""

while alignment threshold increase the skew increases with direct proportion for all test it seems, for all the test based on the records, 
it can be conducted after 15 minute the skew in range of 8ms, also for the other time duration the skew values 
are quite close to each other in milisecond domain, not much difference occuried in compare to the other parameters changing such as drift tolerance. 
But of course this does not mean the skew always keep same in each time duration of records in each alignment threshold values.
