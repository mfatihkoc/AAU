Here, recording is containing four set of audio recording 1 minute in each sets. The following observations are from the last piece of the all 1 minutes recording

(Audio 1 #1) 0 min - 1 min     : slave 2 is 7ms (329 samples) forward from slave1   
(Audio 1 #2) 5 min - 6 min     : slave 2 is 5ms (245 samples) forward from slave1
(Audio 1 #3) 10 min - 11 min   : slave 2 is 13ms (362 samples) forward from slave1
(Audio 1 #4) 15 min - 16 min   : slave 2 is 21ms (1031 samples) forward from slave1


gstreamer strings: 

rtpjitterbuffer mode=1 ( Slave receiver to sender clock)

slave-method=1 (Different possible clock slaving algorithms used when the internal audio clock is not selected as the pipeline master clock
GST_AUDIO_BASE_SINK_SLAVE_SKEW (1) â€“ Adjust playout pointer when master clock drifts too much.)

drift-tolerance=10000 (Controls the amount of time in microseconds that clocks are allowed to drift before resynchronisation happens)

discont-wait=1000 (A window of time in nanoseconds to wait before creating a discontinuity as a result of breaching the drift-tolerance)
