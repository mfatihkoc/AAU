Here, recording is containing four set of audio recording 1 minute in each sets. The following observations are from the last piece of the all 1 minutes recording

(Audio 1 #1) 0 min -  1 min    : slave 1 is 0.000s (4 samples) forward from slave2   (although from here I observed the both channel peace are seem perfectly synchronized, 
When I zoom I lot I have seen after initially it behaves like slave 2 is forward to slave1)
(Audio 1 #2) 5 min - 6 min     : slave 2 is 8ms (384 samples) forward from slave1
(Audio 1 #3) 10 min - 11 min   : slave 2 is 16ms (782 samples) forward from slave1
(Audio 1 #4) 15 min - 16 min   : slave 2 is 14ms (697 samples) forward from slave1


gstreamer strings: 

rtpjitterbuffer mode=0 (Control the buffering and timestamping mode used by the jitterbuffer, only using RTP timestamps)

slave-method=1 (Different possible clock slaving algorithms used when the internal audio clock is not selected as the pipeline master clock
GST_AUDIO_BASE_SINK_SLAVE_SKEW (1) â€“ Adjust playout pointer when master clock drifts too much.)

drift-tolerance=10000 (Controls the amount of time in microseconds that clocks are allowed to drift before resynchronisation happens)

discont-wait=1000 (A window of time in nanoseconds to wait before creating a discontinuity as a result of breaching the drift-tolerance)
